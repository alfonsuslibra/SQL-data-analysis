I created a bank databases that include 5 tables that is, 
a. accounts (columns -> account_number, acc_type, cust_id, balance)
b. branch (columns -> branch_name, branch_code)
c. customers (columns -> customer_id, first_name, last_name, phone_no, address, dob, is_active)
d. employee (columns -> emp_id, first_name, last_name, salary, branch_code)
e. transactions (columns -> trns_id, trns_type, trns_date, acc_number, amount, status)
