## Readme

For this practice, I used real dataset from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results?resource=download that consist two tables, that is OLYMPIC_HISTORY (columns -> id, name, sex, age, height, weight, team, noc, games, year, season, city, sport, event, and medal) and OLYMPIC_HISTORY_NOC_REGIONS (columns -> noc, regions, notes). 

I write SQL Query to solve several problem.
