## Readme

I created a painting database that include 4 tables that is, a. artists (columns -> id, first_name, last_name) b. collectors (columns -> id, first_name, last_name) c. paintings (columns -> id, name, artist_id, listed_price) d. sales (columns -> id, sale_date, painting_id, artist_id, collector_id, sales_price)

I write SQL Query to solve several problem.
